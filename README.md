This pipeline is designed to use raw data from the PowUnity GPS dataset and classify each trip into a category based on it's features.
The pipeline follows these steps:
1. pre_processing.ipynb
2. creating_features.ipynb
3. generating_location_context.ipynb
4. clustering_trips.ipynb
5. graph_clustered_trips.ipynb

The created clusters can be viewed in GMMCluster0, GMMCluster1, GMMCluster2, GMMCluster3.
